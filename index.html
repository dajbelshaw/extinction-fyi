    <p><strong><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/16/mediocrity-is-the-enemy-of-the-solution/">Mediocrity Is The Enemy Of The Solution</a></strong> (CleanTechnica) &mdash; "Photosynthesis is only 1% efficient. Solar panels are 20% efficient. Thus, a solar panel needs 1/20th the land as a biofuel to produce the same energy. On top of that, an electric car uses 1/4th the energy as an internal-combustion engine car to go the same distance. Thus, a battery-electric car running on solar energy uses 1/80th the land as an ethanol-fueled car."</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea">Aral Sea</a></strong> (Wikipedia) &mdash; "Formerly the fourth largest lake in the world with an area of 68,000 km2 (26,300 sq mi), the Aral Sea began shrinking in the 1960s after the rivers that fed it were diverted by Soviet irrigation projects...  The Aral Sea region is heavily polluted, with consequent serious public health problems. UNESCO has added historical documents concerning the Aral Sea to its Memory of the World Register as a resource to study the environmental tragedy."</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://nori.com/podcasts/reversing-climate-change/S2E53-Paul-Kingsnorth-on-the-shared-roots-of-climate-crisis--transhumanism---immortality-era5om">S2E53: Paul Kingsnorth on the shared roots of climate crisis, transhumanism, & immortality</a></strong> (Reversing Climate Change) &mdash; "Paul shares his take on capitalism versus distributism, describing how systems of radical local democracy would root us in community and prevent the kind of scale that leads to tyranny."</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://time.com/5947430/bottom-trawling-carbon-emissions-study/">How Industrial Fishing Creates More CO2 Emissions Than Air Travel</a></strong> (TIME) emdash; "According to calculations conducted by the report‚Äôs 26 authors, bottom trawling is responsible for one gigaton of carbon emissions a year‚Äîa higher annual total than (pre-pandemic) aviation emissions. Not only does the practice contribute to climate change, it is extremely damaging to ocean biodiversity‚Äîthe ‚Äúequivalent of ploughing an old-growth forest into the ground, over and over and over again until there is nothing left‚Äù according to lead author Enric Sala, a marine biologist who is also National Geographic‚Äôs Explorer in Residence."

It would take 3 to 5 [times] less energy to mine this gold than to mine the same value in Bitcoins."</p>
