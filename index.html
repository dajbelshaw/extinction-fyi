    <p><strong><a href="https://newatlas.com/environment/fossilized-plants-greenland-ice-sheet/">Fossilized plants discovered a mile beneath Greenland ice sheet</a></strong> (New Atlas) &mdash; "Finding these frozen plants may sound like an intriguing curiosity, but the researchers say there‚Äôs a concerning implication to the discovery. It suggests that the Greenland Ice Sheet is more susceptible to climate change than anticipated ‚Äì which is a problem, considering it contains enough ice that, if it were to completely melt, it would raise sea levels by 7.2 m (24 ft) alone. Worse still, a recent report found that the ice sheet has lost 3.8 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, and the rate is accelerating." <mark>#oceans</mark></p>

The characters take walks IRL; they play Minecraft with sticks and leaves; they get ‚Äúway into‚Äù D&D." <mark>#tech</mark></p>

For example, the cabling over the canals could potentially complicate maintenance, even if said maintenance wouldn't have to happen as often. And the canals aren't always located near sites that would be easy to connect to California's power grid. Unlike a more compact site, wiring up a long, stretched-out row of panels could add considerably to the cost." <mark>#solar</mark> <mark>#tech</mark></p>

If all were built, about 13.5 million tons of methane would be released annually, doing the damage of an equivalent of more than 1 billion tons of CO2." <mark>#emissions</mark> <mark>#energy</mark></p>

The report states that sulphur dioxide, given off by the burning of oil, can cause ‚Äúdifficulty in breathing‚Äù while nitrogen dioxide, also given off by vehicles and power plants, can cause lung damage and that ‚Äúthere will be a clamor to reduce [nitrogen dioxide] emissions, probably based on suspected long-term chronic effects‚Äù." <mark>#emissions</mark> <mark>#energy</mark></p>

</a></strong> (The Guardian) &mdash; "This page will track a selection of the planet‚Äôs vital signs, from carbon dioxide levels to Arctic sea ice, and act as a reference point. The graphs are fed from data sources including Nasa, the US National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They will automatically update and follow the Earth‚Äôs climate trajectory, providing a visual representation of the climate crisis." <mark>#data</mark> <mark>#emissions</mark></p>

    <p><strong><a href="http://iflas.blogspot.com/2021/02/peer-reviewed-research-in-psychology-on.html">Peer-reviewed research in psychology on the impacts of discussing difficult futures such as societal collapse</a></strong> (IFLAS) &mdash; "This paper presents a review of psychology research that can help people begin to assess the different ways they can responsibly support each other to talk about their thoughts and feelings on their perceptions of societal disruption and collapse, at home and abroad, due to environmental and climate change. It includes a summary of a review of published studies in psychology on matters of anticipating difficult futures, including vulnerability, disruption, disaster, suffering and mortality. The claims by both specialists and non-specialists that collapse anticipation is necessarily harmful to mental health and social engagement is shown to be theoretically and empirically weak. Instead, the research that suggests we engage each other on this upsetting topic to promote coping. It highlights the potential for that engagement to support people with processing difficult emotions and thus finding more pro-social and pro-environmental ways of responding to societal disturbances. The research is preceded by an extended foreword which locates this literature review in the context of the growing fields of Collapsology and Deep Adaptation." <mark>#research</mark></p>

This has led to some climate campaigners to urge people to eat less meat but the UC Davis researchers said that existing meat production could be made better for the climate by putting seaweed on the menu for cattle." <mark>#emissions</mark> <mark>#food</mark></p>

For a community putatively committed to scientific empiricism, this is an extraordinary conviction. Despite reams of increasingly apocalyptic research, and despite 25 years of largely fruitless international climate negotiations, carbon emissions have continued to rise, and temperatures along with them. We are at nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius of warming already‚Äîmore than 2 degrees Fahrenheit over preindustrial averages‚Äîand three-tenths of a degree away from blowing the Paris accord‚Äôs aspiration to limit warming to a still-calamitous 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists now expect us to hit that threshold in about 10 years, and large swaths of the Arctic have been in actual flames for two summers running, but most governments with the option to do so are still feeding the beast that got us here." <mark>#capitalism</mark> <mark>#emissions</mark> <mark>#politics</mark></p>

People should not have to be starving, buried under rubble, or flooded out of their homes before the world pays attention." <mark>#disaster</mark> <mark>#risk</mark></p>       <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/09/its-unavoidable-we-must-ban-fossil-fuels-to-save-our-planet-heres-how-we-do-it">It's unavoidable: we must ban fossil fuels to save our planet. Here's how we do it</a></strong> (The Guardian) &mdash; "Since we have already drawn down over 120 Gt of CO2 from this carbon budget, we have now less than 300 Gt left. Combining the proved fossil fuel reserves reported in British Petroleum‚Äôs Statistical Review of World Energy with CO2 emission factors from the IPCC yields 3,600 Gt of CO2 emissions. This means that we can only afford to burn one twelfth of the fossil fuels we have already found. And this does not account for any greenhouse gas emissions from the ongoing melting of permafrost. The Arctic region alone is estimated to have 1,500 Gt of carbon stored in its soils, some of which is already being converted to CO2 by microbes and released into the atmosphere." <mark>#energy</mark> <mark>#politics</mark></p>

It took over 200 years to reach a 25% increase by 1986. By 2011 ‚Äì 25 years later ‚Äì the increase reached 40%. Now after one more decade it is reaching 50%." <mark>#emissions</mark></p>

Internationally, depending on the price of oil, governments provide up to $1 trillion in subsidies, each year. Add costs related to climate change and other despoiling of the environment, plus war and negative health impacts, and, according to a 2015 study by the International Monetary Fund, the unpaid costs of fossil fuels clock in each year at around $5.3 trillion annually ‚Äì or a breathtaking $10 million a minute. Don‚Äôt hold us to it, but that‚Äôs more money even than Jeff Bezos makes." <mark>#capitalism</mark> <mark>#politics</mark></p>

Solar panels are 20% efficient. Thus, a solar panel needs 1/20th the land as a biofuel to produce the same energy. On top of that, an electric car uses 1/4th the energy as an internal-combustion engine car to go the same distance. Thus, a battery-electric car running on solar energy uses 1/80th the land as an ethanol-fueled car." <mark>#energy</mark> <mark>#solar</mark> <mark>#transport</mark></p>

The Aral Sea region is heavily polluted, with consequent serious public health problems.

Not only does the practice contribute to climate change, it is extremely damaging to ocean biodiversity‚Äîthe ‚Äúequivalent of ploughing an old-growth forest into the ground, over and over and over again until there is nothing left‚Äù according to lead author Enric Sala, a marine biologist who is also National Geographic‚Äôs Explorer in Residence." <mark>#emissions</mark> <mark>#oceans</mark> <mark>#biodiversity</mark></p>
