    <p><strong><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/161575/climate-change-effects-hurtling-toward-global-suicide">We‚Äôre Hurtling Toward Global Suicide</a></strong>  (New Republic) &mdash; "A strange sort of faith lies at the core of mainstream climate advocacy‚Äîa largely unexamined belief that the very system that got us into this mess is the one that will get us out of it. For a community putatively committed to scientific empiricism, this is an extraordinary conviction. Despite reams of increasingly apocalyptic research, and despite 25 years of largely fruitless international climate negotiations, carbon emissions have continued to rise, and temperatures along with them. We are at nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius of warming already‚Äîmore than 2 degrees Fahrenheit over preindustrial averages‚Äîand three-tenths of a degree away from blowing the Paris accord‚Äôs aspiration to limit warming to a still-calamitous 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists now expect us to hit that threshold in about 10 years, and large swaths of the Arctic have been in actual flames for two summers running, but most governments with the option to do so are still feeding the beast that got us here." #capitalism #emissions #politics</p>        
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2021/3/18/revenge-of-the-nerds-disaster-risk-reduction-and-climate-change">Revenge of the nerds: Disaster risk reduction and climate change</a></strong> (The New Humanitarian) &mdash; "Investing in disaster risk reduction isn‚Äôt a matter of saving for a rainy day; it‚Äôs jerking the wheel to avoid the boulder that is quite clearly on the road ahead. People should not have to be starving, buried under rubble, or flooded out of their homes before the world pays attention." #disaster #risk</p>        
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/09/its-unavoidable-we-must-ban-fossil-fuels-to-save-our-planet-heres-how-we-do-it">It's unavoidable: we must ban fossil fuels to save our planet. Here's how we do it</a></strong> (The Guardian) &mdash; "Since we have already drawn down over 120 Gt of CO2 from this carbon budget, we have now less than 300 Gt left. Combining the proved fossil fuel reserves reported in British Petroleum‚Äôs Statistical Review of World Energy with CO2 emission factors from the IPCC yields 3,600 Gt of CO2 emissions. This means that we can only afford to burn one twelfth of the fossil fuels we have already found. And this does not account for any greenhouse gas emissions from the ongoing melting of permafrost. The Arctic region alone is estimated to have 1,500 Gt of carbon stored in its soils, some of which is already being converted to CO2 by microbes and released into the atmosphere." #energy #politics</p>        
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/met-office-atmospheric-co2-now-hitting-50-higher-than-pre-industrial-levels">Met Office: Atmospheric CO2 now hitting 50% higher than pre-industrial levels</a></strong> (Carbon Brief) &mdash; "[A]s human-driven emissions have increased, the rise in CO2 has accelerated. It took over 200 years to reach a 25% increase by 1986. By 2011 ‚Äì 25 years later ‚Äì the increase reached 40%. Now after one more decade it is reaching 50%. " #emissions</p>        
    <p><strong><a href="https://jalopnik.com/trillions-for-oil-millions-for-evs-the-big-lie-of-ine-1846476419">Trillions For Oil, Millions For EVs: The Big Lie Of Ineffectual Government</a></strong> (Jalopnik) &mdash; "Ignoring the fact that every dollar spent subsidizing oil diverts money away from other societally valuable enterprises ‚Äì say public health, mass transit or feeding the hungry ‚Äì the dollars are still staggering. Internationally, depending on the price of oil, governments provide up to $1 trillion in subsidies, each year. Add costs related to climate change and other despoiling of the environment, plus war and negative health impacts, and, according to a 2015 study by the International Monetary Fund, the unpaid costs of fossil fuels clock in each year at around $5.3 trillion annually ‚Äì or a breathtaking $10 million a minute. Don‚Äôt hold us to it, but that‚Äôs more money even than Jeff Bezos makes." #capitalism #politics</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/16/mediocrity-is-the-enemy-of-the-solution/">Mediocrity Is The Enemy Of The Solution</a></strong> (CleanTechnica) &mdash; "Photosynthesis is only 1% efficient. Solar panels are 20% efficient. Thus, a solar panel needs 1/20th the land as a biofuel to produce the same energy. On top of that, an electric car uses 1/4th the energy as an internal-combustion engine car to go the same distance. Thus, a battery-electric car running on solar energy uses 1/80th the land as an ethanol-fueled car." #energy #solar #transport</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea">Aral Sea</a></strong> (Wikipedia) &mdash; "Formerly the fourth largest lake in the world with an area of 68,000 km2 (26,300 sq mi), the Aral Sea began shrinking in the 1960s after the rivers that fed it were diverted by Soviet irrigation projects...  The Aral Sea region is heavily polluted, with consequent serious public health problems. UNESCO has added historical documents concerning the Aral Sea to its Memory of the World Register as a resource to study the environmental tragedy." #oceans</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://nori.com/podcasts/reversing-climate-change/S2E53-Paul-Kingsnorth-on-the-shared-roots-of-climate-crisis--transhumanism---immortality-era5om">S2E53: Paul Kingsnorth on the shared roots of climate crisis, transhumanism, & immortality</a></strong> (Reversing Climate Change) &mdash; "Paul shares his take on capitalism versus distributism, describing how systems of radical local democracy would root us in community and prevent the kind of scale that leads to tyranny." #democracy #capitalism #podcast</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://time.com/5947430/bottom-trawling-carbon-emissions-study/">How Industrial Fishing Creates More CO2 Emissions Than Air Travel</a></strong> (TIME) &mdash; "According to calculations conducted by the report‚Äôs 26 authors, bottom trawling is responsible for one gigaton of carbon emissions a year‚Äîa higher annual total than (pre-pandemic) aviation emissions. Not only does the practice contribute to climate change, it is extremely damaging to ocean biodiversity‚Äîthe ‚Äúequivalent of ploughing an old-growth forest into the ground, over and over and over again until there is nothing left‚Äù according to lead author Enric Sala, a marine biologist who is also National Geographic‚Äôs Explorer in Residence." #emissions #oceans #biodiversity</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://medium.com/crypto-lucid/buying-a-tesla-in-bitcoins-cancels-4-times-the-co2-savings-for-its-whole-lifetime-c28b042e3b9a">Buying a Tesla in Bitcoins cancels 4 times the CO2 savings for its whole lifetime</a></strong> (Crypto Lucid) &mdash; "Suppose you want to buy this car with gold. It would take 3 to 5 [times] less energy to mine this gold than to mine the same value in Bitcoins." #crypto #emissions #transport</p>
