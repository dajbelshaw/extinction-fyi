			<title>Pollution from fossil fuel combustion deadlier than previously thought</title>

			<description>A new study found that fine particulate pollution generated by the burning of fossil fuels was responsible for one in five early deaths worldwide in 2018—far more than previously thought. Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Aaron Bernstein said that the people most at risk are those “who can least afford it.”</description>

			<description>Meanwhile, the Climate Change Committee, the body that advises government on how to meet its statutory emissions reduction goals, has suggested the UK needs to scale up public and private investment to £50bn a year by 2030 to achieve its net-zero goals. Looking across the Atlantic, the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) has suggested that, to mirror President Joe Biden’s $1.9trn stimulus proposal, the UK should embark on a recovery programme worth £190bn.</description>

			<title>Hundreds of millions of people could be affected by heatwaves within 30 years - study</title>

			<description>Earlier this month, Oxford University researchers estimated that there had already been 1,500 UK deaths attributable to climate change events. Scientists linked the deaths to heatwaves in 2003 and 2018, which saw record temperatures broken in cities such as Glasgow and Belfast.</description>

			<title>Small nuclear power plants no use in climate crisis</title>

			<description>There is a clear crossover between civil and nuclear industries in the US, the UK, China, Russia and France. This is made more obvious because of the few countries that have renounced nuclear weapons − for example only Germany, Italy and Spain have shown no interest in building any kind of nuclear station. This is simply because renewables are cheaper and produce low carbon power far more quickly.</description>

			<title>How bad for the climate is bingeing Netflix?</title>
			<link>https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/netflix-stream-binge-emissions-study-b1820762.html</link>
			<source url="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/netflix-stream-binge-emissions-study-b1820762.html">The Independent</source>
			<description>Using the data, Netflix has revealed some stats on its emissions for the first time. The company says that one hour of streaming uses less than 100g CO2 equivalent (emissions from all greenhouse gases, not just CO2). Wired reports that this is similar to driving a car for a quarter of a mile, or running a 1,000-watt air-conditioning unit for 15 minutes in the US (and for 40 minutes in Europe).</description>

			<description>Mel Evans from Greenpeace said: “This is a colossal failure. The UK will make a fool of itself in the run-up to hosting the COP26 global climate talks if our energy minister signs off on new oil and gas licences that serve to rip up the Paris Agreement (the world deal to hold global temperature rise to 1.5C)."</description>

			<title>Big banks’ trillion-dollar finance for fossil fuels ‘shocking’, says report</title>

			<description>A commitment to be net zero by 2050 has been made by 17 of the 60 banks, but the report describes the pledges as “dangerously weak, half-baked, or vague”, arguing that action is needed today. Some banks have policies that block finance for coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, but almost two-thirds of funding is for oil and gas companies.</description>

			<title>Unpaid environmental damages from fossil fuels are a $600B annual subsidy</title>

			<description>The producers' slice of the pie comes in at $71 billion in 2018 and averaged $62 billion over the study period. Gasoline was the largest portion of that, averaging $25 billion, with coal and natural gas varying with the changing usage pattern. Here, the split was quite different, with gasoline and diesel coming in at under $50 billion, natural gas at about $20 billion, and coal at about $10 billion.</description>

			<title>Ending Fossil Fuel Subsidies the Wrong Way Could End Up Hurting the Poor</title>

			<source url="https://truthout.org/articles/elite-led-efforts-to-end-fossil-fuel-subsidies-have-a-hidden-neoliberal-agenda">Truthout</source>
			<description>If the dollar value of subsidies has indeed been inflated for political and ideological purposes, then the same can be said of the emissions reductions estimates that derive from them. The IMF maintains that, if users paid the “full price” for fossil-based energy, consumption would fall and a more efficient use of energy would eventually follow. But the relationship between prices, fossil fuel use, and emissions reductions is based on what economists call “elasticities.” Research has shown that the “price-demand ratio” can be quite pronounced when consumers have alternative energy options. But when alternatives don’t exist—which is often the case—increases in prices produce a “low to moderate” reduction in demand. According to the IMF, “Consistent, country-level models of how fossil fuel use responds to price reform are not yet available on a wide scale.” In other words, the IMF’s assertion that “getting energy prices right” will dramatically curtail energy use is politically convenient, but it is not always supported by the data.</description>

			<title>JP Morgan warns of end to human life in climate report</title>

			<description>According to JP Morgan's research, titled <em>Risky business: the climate and the macroeconomy</em>, the impact of climate change will be broad and devastating. The economists call on world leaders to introduce a global carbon tax to prevent a meltdown, saying no other measure is likely to be enough.</description>
