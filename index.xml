			<title>What your red meat habit is doing to the planet</title>
			<link>https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/red-meat-beef-carbon-footprint-b1854133.html</link>
			<source url="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/red-meat-beef-carbon-footprint-b1854133.html">The Independent</source>
			<description>Farming animals is responsible for 14.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and the production of red meat accounts for 41 per cent of those emissions, according to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization... Per gram of protein, beef emits 20 times more emissions than pulses such as beans and lentils, and four times more than dairy products.</description>

			<title>Human-induced global heating ‘causes over a third of heat deaths’</title>
			<link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/31/human-induced-global-heating-causes-over-third-heat-deaths</link>
			<source url="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/31/human-induced-global-heating-causes-over-third-heat-deaths">The Guardian</source>
			<description>A study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, used data from 732 locations in 43 countries to calculate the number of deaths attributed to heat levels higher than the ideal temperature for human health, which varies across locations... Overall, they found 37&#37; of all heat-related deaths in the locations studied were attributable to human activity – but the largest climate change-induced contributions (more than 50&#37;) were in southern and western Asia (Iran and Kuwait), south-east Asia (the Philippines and Thailand) and Central and South America.</description>

			<description>Through programmes like Good Grief Network - 10-Steps to Personal Resilience &#38; Empowerment in a Chaotic Climate, Neto now tries to help others move past eco-distress. &#34;It’s not therapy. It’s peer-to-peer support. These groups certainly help me feel I’ve got choice – I can channel my righteous anger to make a difference in whatever small way I can.&#34;</description>

			<description>The landmark decision comes after eight Australian teenagers filed a claim with the Federal Court, seeking an injunction to &#34;restrain an apprehended breach of the duty,&#34; that they believed the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment owes them and other Australian children. As a result of the age of the applicants, the proceedings were brought by their representative, 86 year-old Sister Marie Brigid Arthur, who is a Sister of the Brigidine Order of Victoria.</description>

			<description>Climate activists have scored a milestone victory over big oil following a court ruling against Shell and investor action to force boardroom changes at ExxonMobil. A Dutch court ordered Shell to drastically cut its carbon footprint, while ExxonMobil was forced to accept activists on to its board. The landmark court ruling in The Hague marks the first time a fossil fuel company has been held accountable for its contribution to climate change and forced to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout its whole supply chain.</description>

			<description>Between 2001 and 2021, 28 cyclones formed in the Arabian Sea, along with a marked increase in storm intensity, fuelled by rising sea surface temperatures which reached as high as 31C (88F). A 2016 Nature study found anthropogenic global heating had contributed to the increased frequency of extremely severe cyclonic storms over the Arabian Sea.</description>

			<description>A giant digital display in New York’s Union Square is counting down second by second how much time humanity has to solve the climate crisis before it slips past a point of irreversible change. At the time of writing, it shows that the world must achieve zero emissions within six years, 219 days, one hour, six minutes and two seconds. By the time you read this, it will have ticked down further.</description>

			<description>The UK has set a target to net zero carbon emissions which would involved big changes to the way we live our lives, how we heat our homes and how we manage the emissions we do produce. This new study aims to test out would involve large areas of land being dedicated to removing rid of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air.</description>

			<description>One does not need to be a conspiracy theorist to recognise, with Foucault, that power shapes knowledge. If profits and economic growth are the benchmarks of success in a society, it simply may not be profitable to expose a society as insane, and even members of an insane society may sooner choose wilful blindness than look too deeply into the subconscious of their own culture.</description>

			<description>Earth’s many ecosystems are incredibly complex and remarkably fragile. The expansion and industrialization of the human race has triggered mass habitat destruction, the introduction of pollution and invasive species, and has prompted a steady but dramatic shift in our planet’s climate.</description>

			<title>Climate Change Threatens Africa’s Cultural Heritage</title>

			<source url="https://blog.ucsusa.org/adam-markham/climate-change-threatens-africas-cultural-heritage">Union of Concerned Scientists</source>
			<description>All these changes threaten cultural heritage in Africa, including the tangible—such as historic buildings, archaeological sites and museum collections— and the intangible, including seasonal festivals, sacred sites and traditional fishing practices and foodways. To take just one example, the water levels of Lake Malawi have dropped in recent decades and rainfall there has become more unpredictable with longer drier periods and more extreme weather events, putting at risk traditional fishing practices that rely on some of the highest freshwater fish biodiversity on the planet. </description>

			<description>&#91;The report&#93; highlights the financial industry as one of the UK’s largest contributors to the climate crisis, and means that if the City were its own country, it would outrank Germany as the ninth largest emitter of CO2 in the world. Germany was responsible for emitting 776m tonnes of carbon in 2018, according to the latest available data.</description>

			<description>As the planet warms, animals may further evolve to withstand the effects of heat on fertility. But the speed at which a species can adapt may be too slow to ensure their survival. Our research has shown both tropical and widespread species of flies could not increase their fertility when exposed to simulated global warming, even after 25 generations.</description>

			<description>Many indigenous groups got to know their natural environments intimately and sustained themselves over millennia, often despite harsh conditions. They came to understand the limits of what these environments could support, and they grasped that caring for the environment was simultaneously an act of self-care. Pacific islanders would designate no-go areas of the ocean to avoid overfishing, while high-altitude farmers in the Andes would rely on terraces that reduced erosion to grow their crops. It is not a coincidence that as much as 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity is located within territories inhabited by indigenous peoples.</description>

			<description>The individual responsibility narrative was honed in tobacco-industry messaging and began migrating to fossil fuels in the mid-2000s, Supran and Oreskes write. Case in point&#58; the ultimate metaphor of individual responsibility, the &#34;carbon footprint,&#34; entered common parlance around that time via BP Plc’s &#34;beyond petroleum&#34; campaign. Between 2005 and 2007, BP was spending at least $100 million a year on marketing alone, according to a figure cited in the One Earth study.</description>

			<description>&#34;I think the emphasis on planting trees is risky or even a misplaced dream unless we first put priority on reducing or halting climate change, because the trees are going to be stressed—they are getting stressed now,&#34; says Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan and one of the authors of an op-ed in Science arguing that the world needs to rethink how much we rely on tree planting as a climate solution.</description>

			<title>Overpopulation is not the problem it once was, says Marco Magrini</title>

			<source url="http://geographical.co.uk/opinion/item/4017-overpopulation-is-not-be-the-problem-it-once-was-says-marco-magrini">Geographical</source>
			<description>A new book has shed fresh light on the old overpopulation dilemma, this time from a completely different point of view. In 'Count Down', Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai epidemiologist Shanna Swan argues that the human race could gradually disappear because of increasing infertility. It may sound like something out of a dystopian novel, but the evidence is stark&#58; in the past 40 years, global sperm counts have halved, while female fertility has also dropped. &#34;The current state of reproductive affairs can’t continue much longer without threatening human survival&#34;, Swan writes... She explicitly compares the fertility crisis to climate change: two invisible and long-term threats. But there’s more. For the most part, they both spring from the same evil – fossil fuels. The main culprits of the falling sperm count are oil-derived molecules, in particular phthalates and bisphenol-A used in plastics, fertilisers and cosmetics, which disrupt the endocrine system.</description>

			<description>Progressives must avoid being seen as the advocates of heavy-handed restrictions if we want action on climate change. The counter-argument should be: fossil fuel companies are stifling innovation and closing down your options for a good future. The market’s not going to deliver better choices on its own. If you want an open future, with new technologies and new possibilities, join us.</description>

			<description>The UN’s 2020 Emissions Gap report says that limiting temperature rises to 1.5C, as envisaged by the 2015 Paris Agreement, would require the richest 1 per cent to cut their carbon footprint by 2030 “by at least a factor of 30”. Almost everything the wealthy do involves higher emissions, from living in bigger houses to running larger cars and flying more often, especially by private jet. Eating meat comes into it, as does owning a swimming pool. Not to mention a holiday home. Or homes.</description>

			<description>After nearly two days of wrangling at a meeting of the G7 environment and energy ministers, hosted virtually by the UK on Thursday and Friday, all reaffirmed their commitment to limiting global heating to 1.5C, and committed to phasing out coal and fully decarbonising their energy sectors in the 2030s... The G7 communique contains a caveat, the Guardian understands, at the behest of the Japanese government, that would allow financing for coal in “limited circumstances at the discretion of each country”. It is understood this will only be used in exceptional circumstances.</description>

But in the Arctic-boreal forests of Alaska, Siberia, Canada's Northwest Territories and similar landscapes, fires can burn deep into the carbon-rich soil where they linger and lurk, often undetected.</description>

YouGov asked a weighted sample of 1700 people to rank the 10 key areas outlined in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. Five times as many people supported the prioritisation of renewable energy as the top choice than any other green industry.</description>

			<description>The number of countries which have pledged to reach net zero has grown, but even if their commitments are fully achieved, there will still be 22 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide worldwide in 2050 which would lead to temperature rise of around 2.1C by 2100, the IEA said in its "Net Zero by 2050" report.</description>

			<description>Last week’s updates to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Indicators website, which had been delayed for years by the Trump administration, showed that major U.S. cities experienced three times as many heat waves—four or more days with temperatures that should only occur every 10 years—in the 2010s as during the 1960s. The season in which heat waves occur has lengthened by 47 days. In addition to heat exhaustion, recent research also showed that extreme heat dramatically increases the chances of pre-term births.</description>

			<description>You don’t see political borders from space—only humanity as a whole. We’re facing one of the greatest challenges in the history of humankind, but we are a very capable and resilient species. We can meet this challenge by leveraging solar power and new advances in battery storage. This is our century’s moonshot, and we need to rise to the challenge.</description>

			<description>Studies outside Britain suggest silvopasture’s benefits include sequestering additional carbon, reducing flooding, increasing drought-resilience, improving animal health and weight and boosting biodiversity... The trial, involving seven farms in Devon and scientists from Rothamsted Research and the Organic Research Centre, is the brainchild of Luke Dale-Harris of the charity Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group. It is being co-funded by the Woodland Trust and Innovative Farmers, a Soil Association programme helping farmers participate in agricultural research.</description>

			<description>Indeed, while many in the media have seized on &#34;greenwashing&#34; — companies embracing sustainable practices for public relations purposes — a far greater danger is &#34;brown-spinning&#34;&#58; selling off the highest-emitting components of businesses to private equity and hedge fund actors at a discount. This can reduce disclosure, shield polluters and marginalise the voice of the investor.</description>

With only six months left the clock is ticking, if the government wants to be climate leaders it's time they act like it.&#34;</description>

			<description>Once the train of events is set in motion, dramatic ice loss would occur over the next several centuries. &#34;In the century after 2100, it’s potentially catastrophic,&#34; &#91;Robert DeConto, an expert in polar climate change at the University of Massachusetts&#93; says. &#34;If we did nothing at all to reduce emissions we could get 5 metres of sea level rise just from Antarctica by 2200, at which point you’d have to remap the world from space. It would be unimaginable.&#34;</description>

			<description>Developments in Italy and the UK both point at the creeping and dangerous ways in which some governments are clamping down on the right to protest. That these regulations are mostly targeting environmental protesters is no surprise&#58; public awareness has substantially grown over the past years and more and more people are being mobilised. Attempts to constrain such mobilisation should be resisted as they are unnecessary, disproportionate and ultimately inconsistent with efforts to tackle global climate change.</description>

This cost will mount further if new oil and licenses are issued, in what campaigners say directly contravenes the UK’s commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</description>

			<description>When you look at the true cost of the damage to the atmosphere, politicians’ claims that action on carbon reduction is too expensive become bizarre. When we burn fossil fuels, we’ve never factored in the ultimate cost of the damage to the atmosphere caused by excess CO2. In many countries, if you pollute a waterway, you have to clean it up or pay a substantial fee for the damage – that cost has to be factored in to the cost of running your business. In the case of emitting CO2 into the atmosphere, you can do that for little or no upfront and immediate cost. Are we offended by people polluting waterways because it is literally in your face whereas CO2 is a transparent gas&#63;</description>

			<title>How the cult of Bill Gates is leading us towards a climate disaster</title>
			<link>https://www.varsity.co.uk/opinion/21359</link>
			<source url="https://www.varsity.co.uk/opinion/21359">Varsity</source>
			<description>Ultimately, Gates’s technological &#39;solutions&#39; to the climate crisis are flawed, because they do not fundamentally change anything about the way our society functions. In doing so, they justify the status quo, based on destructive extractivism and excessive consumption. For instance, Gates’ solution for the emissions caused by aviation is to replace jet fuels with biofuels &#45; but this is a replacement, not a solution. It does not address the root causes, and is likely to cause more problems that it solves. It’s evident that Gates has the most to lose from more radical solutions to the climate crisis, which attempt to address our capitalist society’s obsession with economic growth, its ignorance of ecological boundaries, and its inherent inequalities. Gates does not want a new normal. He wants very much the same normal &#45; just with less carbon emissions.</description>

			<description>The effects of marine heatwaves can reverberate up the food chain, says Pippa Moore, a marine-community ecologist at Newcastle University, UK. Warm, low-nutrient water in the Northwest Pacific during a 2013–16 marine heatwave known as The Blob devastated phytoplankton growth. Then, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations plunged, and as many as one million seabirds died in the Gulf of Alaska. Marine heatwaves have also caused massive amounts of coral bleaching in reefs around the world over the past several decades.</description>

			<title>The World Is Waking Up to the Truth That Natural Gas Is Dirty</title>

			<description>Methane is shorter-lived than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere but as much as 86 times as potent a warming agent over the 20-year period after it’s emitted. It’s as much as 34 times more potent over 100 years. And despite suggestions to the contrary, it’s not planet-friendly when it’s burned, either&#59; used as fuel, it emits roughly half as much carbon dioxide as coal but is hardly carbon-neutral. In 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency reported that methane rose more, over a single year, than since record-keeping began in the 1980s. Human-caused methane emissions—which account for more than half of the total—stem largely from just three sectors&#58; agriculture (40 percent), waste (20 percent), and fossil fuels (35 percent).</description>

			<description>So what to make of it all&#63; Don’t think there is no real climate action&#58; renewable energy and electric cars are accelerating rapidly. And companies’ pledges can sometimes be impressive, for example Burger King committing to less meat and more plants in the patties it serves up. But until every government and corporate decision has to pass the bullshit test – does it really cut carbon now – then we are kidding ourselves if we think we are treating the climate crisis like the emergency it is.</description>

			<description>If human-caused methane emissions are cut by nearly in half by 2030, a half degree (0.3 degrees Celsius) of warming can be prevented by mid-century, according to Thursday’s report by the United Nations Environment Programme. The report said the methane reduction would be relatively inexpensive and achievable &#45; by plugging leaks in pipelines, stopping venting of natural gas during energy drilling, capturing gas from landfills and reducing methane from belching livestock and other agricultural sources, which is the biggest challenge.</description>

			<source url="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/solar-weather-forecasting">WIRED</source>
			<description>Here’s the problem. On a sunny spring day in Great Britain, solar power can account for about 30 per cent of all the electricity being produced on the island. The exact number varies a lot, but under ideal conditions &#45; solar panels perform best on cool but sunny days &#45; they might churn out nine gigawatts (GW) of energy, a huge chunk of the 30GW average energy demand. So far, so good. But if a big cloud swoops down over the southwest, where many of Great Britain’s solar panels are situated, a significant portion of that renewable energy suddenly disappears from the grid – the equivalent of an entire gas power station instantly going offline. Hundreds of megawatts of energy gone, just like that.</description>

			<description>Melting glaciers and ice sheets and rising sea levels all occur slowly and lag behind surface temperature warming. A zero-emissions world would still result in rising sea levels for many centuries to come, with some estimates suggesting that at least 80cm of additional sea level rise is &#34;locked in&#34;. To stop these impacts may, ultimately, require reducing global temperatures through net-negative global emissions, not just stopping temperature from rising by reaching net-zero.</description>

			<description>A recent Danish&#47;Swedish study about carbon labeling suggests that just knowing a bit more about our emissions really shifts our purchasing habits. Participants reduced the climate impacts of their choices by 25&#37; after choosing to learn about the emissions intensity of their products.</description>

			<description>For one, it will affect ocean predators’ food sources, as prey succumb to the heat or swim to more hospitable waters &#45; generally moving toward the poles &#45; with predators in pursuit. It will also alter habitats (think melting polar ice, but also violent storms burying seagrass beds or tearing up coral reefs). And shifting water conditions—including temperature, acidity, and current patterns—could decrease some species’ ability to reproduce or lead to more disease outbreaks.</description>

			<description>&#34;To illustrate what the future of beer will look like if we don’t get more companies to commit to aggressive climate action, we’ve brewed up Torched Earth Ale. This beer uses the kind of ingredients that would be available in a climate-ravaged future...and they’re less than ideal,&#34; says the company...The 5.2 percent alcohol by volume beer uses hop extracts and dandelions instead of fresh hops and smoke tainted water instead of purified water along with various malt extracts.</description>

			<description>Corporate emissions targets are just &#34;talk&#34;. As Tortoise’s Responsibility100 Index shows, what companies say they do and what they actually do are very different things. If we have a chance of limiting the climate crisis, we need companies to do even better than they currently promise to.</description>

			<description>In 2018, globally, around 108 million people required help from the international humanitarian system as a result of storms, floods, droughts and wildfires. By 2030, it is estimated that this number could increase by almost 50% at a cost of around US$20 billion a year. These growing risks highlight the need to improve the implementation and effectiveness of early warning systems worldwide to strengthen countries’ resilience to multiple weather-, climate- and water-related hazards. For example, the heatwave in Siberia in 2020 triggered widespread fires, with 1.15 million hectares burning in late June, associated with a release of about 56 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, more than the annual emissions of some industrialised countries such as Switzerland and Norway.</description>

			<title>Declassified Satellite Images Show Glaciers Are Melting Faster Than Ever</title>

			<source url="https://earther.gizmodo.com/declassified-satellite-images-show-glaciers-are-melting-1846789832">Gizmodo</source>
			<description>The quickening disappearance of the world’s glaciers isn’t just sad because they’re beautiful—which they are—or because complex ecosystems rely on them—which they do. It also spells disaster for communities who depend on them to live. Greenland, for instance, is home to some 56,000 people—most of whom are Indigenous—who depend on the ice for travel and hunting. As glaciers melt out, it could impact their way of life. Sometimes the threat can be even more acute; a glacier collapse earlier this year in the Himalayas unleashed a deadly flood. Of course, glacial melt everywhere is bad for those of us who live far away from them, too, because it contributes to sea level rise that threatens coastal communities.</description>

			<description>Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro approved a 24% cut to the environment budget for 2021 from last year's level, according to official numbers published on Friday, just one day after he vowed to increase spending to fight deforestation. Speaking on Thursday to the summit organized by U.S. President Joe Biden, Bolsonaro pledged to double the budget for environmental enforcement and end illegal deforestation by 2030.</description>

			<source url="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/23/changes-to-giant-ocean-eddies-could-have-devastating-effects-globally">The Guardian</source>
			<description>The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, analysed the temperature and height of the ocean with the help of data from altimeters on satellites from 1993 until 2020... As well as absorbing about 90% of global heating since the 1970s, the ocean has pulled in about 40% of the extra carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, mainly from fossil fuel burning, since the start of the Industrial Revolution... Solving the puzzle of how these ocean eddies were changing was &#34;one of the last frontiers&#34; in understanding how climate change could be affecting the ocean, &#91;Prof Matthew England, of the Climate Change Research centre at the University of New South Wales&#93; said.</description>

			<description>New research shows that lake &#34;stratification periods&#34; &#45; a seasonal separation of water into layers &#45; will last longer in a warmer climate. These longer periods of stratification could have &#34;far-reaching implications&#34; for lake ecosystems, the paper says, and can drive toxic algal blooms, fish die-offs and increased methane emissions.</description>

Since the mid-20th century, there has been a marked acceleration of carbon dioxide emissions and sea level rise, the destruction of wildlife and the transformation of land by farming, deforestation and development.</description>

			<description>Today is Earth Day, which should provide us with an opportunity to pause and confront the awful predicament humanity faces. We eat microplastics, breathe pollution and watch other life-forms decline to extinction. We face intersecting poverty, health, climate and biodiversity crises. Our global predicament is that consumption by the wealthy is driving us towards planetary disaster&#44; yet billions live in poverty and need to consume more to live well. In this cycle&#44; any version of &#34;success&#34; only hastens catastrophe.</description>

			<description>We need to start connecting the dots between these issues. By incorporating education aid into their broader climate agendas, governments can replace the vicious cycle of displacement, poverty, and insecurity with a new, virtuous cycle. Educated girls are powerful agents of change. With the right education, today’s marginalized and vulnerable young people can build tomorrow’s stronger and more resilient economies and communities.</description>

			<description>A decade ago, the bankrupt owner of the Greenidge power plant in Dresden, New York, sold the uncompetitive coal-fired relic for scrap and surrendered its operating permits. For the next seven years, the plant sat idle on the western shore of Seneca Lake, a monument to the apparent dead end reached by the state’s fossil fuel infrastructure. But today, Greenidge is back up and running as a Bitcoin mining operation.

			<description>&#34;Our planet has seen rapid environmental change in the past half-century — more than any other point in human history. Many of us have experienced these changes in our own communities&#59; I myself was among the thousands of Californians evacuated from their homes during the state’s wildfires last year. For other people, the effects of climate change feel abstract and far away, like melting ice caps and receding glaciers,&#34; a Google representative said in the search giant’s announcement.</description>

			<description>There&#39;s growing recognition in the field of psychology that people are experiencing distress over climate change. More than 40 per cent of Americans felt &#34;disgusted&#34; or &#34;helpless&#34; about climate change, according to a survey published by researchers at Yale University. A 2020 poll from the APA found that more than half of respondents were somewhat or extremely anxious about the effects of climate change on their own mental health. Though not officially classified in the DSM-5, the tome therapists use to classify and treat mental illnesses, there&#39;s a name for this state of despair that has emerged from academic texts and media since as recently as 2007&#58; eco-anxiety.</description>

			<title>To save the planet, focus on corporate-tax free riders</title>
			<link>https://www.ft.com/content/663cba6f-391e-4789-908e-b560936f2eaf</link>

			<description>Free riders matter in combating rising temperatures, because global emissions of greenhouse gases are the core problem. Countries and their populations know that if they make a special effort to be green, others will free ride or cheat in any deal, so there is no incentive to make the required effort. You can see the outcome clearly in the data. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has not deviated from its steady upward march after 30 years of UN climate conferences.</description>

			<description>Natural phenomena have always shaped and reshaped the coastline of Cape Cod. But the process has seemingly accelerated thanks to the impacts of global climate change, especially during recent storm seasons. At some points, according to the Guardian, up to six feet of land was getting swallowed up over the course of a single day.</description>

			<description>The study tracks ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP &#45; four of the biggest &#34;carbon major&#34; oil companies &#45; since 1990. This was around the time the global public heard the first high-profile warning about the dangers of burning fossil fuels. Executives had been told of the threat many years earlier, but instead of working on a transition to cleaner, safer forms of energy, they ramped up production, played down risks and adopted public relations campaigns that misleadingly presented oil companies as part of the solution rather than the source of the problem.</description>

			<description>Only 2.8 per cent of the world’s land surface is &#34;functionally intact&#34;, meaning there has been no loss of species to a point that would affect the healthy functioning of an ecosystem. This was 10 times lower than previous estimates. The research, published in the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change, also estimated estimated around 2.9 per cent of the world’s land surface can be considered &#34;faunally intact&#34; without any loss of animal species.</description>

			<description>Climate change is affecting the pattern of the seasons, with spring occurring around 8.4 days earlier, impacting wildlife such as blue tits which can find their breeding cycles now mismatch their food supply for chicks. While native woods and trees can help curb carbon emissions and reverse declines in wildlife, failing to address the problems will undermine efforts to tackle both the climate and nature crises.</description>

			<description>If we look at the current workforce, more needs to be done to map out where we can repurpose skills and how to enable this shift to begin this year. Training on the job is crucial to support the transition but also re-focus skillsets towards net-zero roles. By being able to take time out of work to complete training and development alongside their current jobs, we can start to plug gaps in areas where skills can be transferred. It&#39;s a solution that can work for all people across different backgrounds and experiences.</description>

			<description>Climate scientists tell us we need not just a deceleration in growth of greenhouse gas emissions, but actual rapid declines to address climate change with any hope of success. Given how we think about acceleration, it’s hard to imagine that our global society will seek accelerated reductions in emissions as a primary goal.</description>

			<description>French officials moved late on Saturday to ban domestic flights on routes that are connected by train and can be travelled in less than two-and-a-half hours. The vote comes as governments around the world look at ways to lower carbon emissions and achieve net-zero targets. 
It forms part of a broader climate bill from France which looks to cut carbon emissions from 1990's levels by 40% by 2030.</description>

			<description>Over the past two years, an extraordinary global campaign has emerged to protect 30 percent of Earth’s total surface from human exploitation by 2030. The members of this so-called 30x30 coalition, which now includes scores of governments, understand that climate change is only one half of the planet’s environmental crisis. The Paris Agreement, while imperative to curb greenhouse gas emissions, will do little by itself to save the planet’s collapsing biodiversity or preserve the massive ecosystems upon which humanity depends—and which we are fast degrading.</description>

			<description>The importance of tackling methane has become more apparent in the past decade and a half. After a plateau which began in 1999, concentrations of the gas in the atmosphere started rising again in 2007, a trend that continues to this day. At the moment, more than 300m tonnes are emitted every year as a consequence of human activity, and that rate is growing. As a result, methane concentrations are now more than two-and-a-half times what they were before the Industrial Revolution, and are rising faster than allowed for in all but the most pessimistic climate projections for the 21st century.</description>

			<description>The residential units are intended for small-scale living; sustainable, self-sufficient, and technologically hyperconnected. To be built, each unit uses recycled materials of natural and local origin, following the logic of kilometer zero materials. Specifically, the architects propose the use of panels and laminates made with American agave wood, popularly known as "desert wood." Its fibers and roots can be reused to make thermal and acoustic insulation systems, thus avoiding artificial products.</description>

			<title>Emotional leadership and environmental crises&#58; a view from nineteenth-century Vietnam</title>

			<description>In the nineteenth century court of the Nguyen dynasty, it would have been unimaginable to be emotionally detached from the environment, in part because the landscape was understood to be full of sentiment. Royal rule required responding to and mediating these emotional flows through sincere behaviour and ritual practice. Today we might discount the notion that rituals are efficacious in the natural world or that human beings can resonate with an emotional environment. And yet, in the current pandemic and climate emergency the idea of how nature &#34;treats us&#34; is more at play than ever before. In this sense, the problems faced by nineteenth century Vietnamese kings &#45; of how to connect with nature and utilise emotion effectively &#45; are ones we all share.</description>

			<description>Critics say voluntary offset markets &#45; unlike mandatory compliance offset programs &#45; are largely unregulated, making it challenging to verify whether reductions actually occur. Even when working perfectly, some worry that they function as a form of &#34;greenwashing&#34; by allowing companies to continue burning fossil fuels and emitting CO2. A forest conservation project in Brazil backed by FIFA for the 2014 World Cup was suspended after loggers destroyed more trees than all the credits sold, ProPublica reported. </description>

			<description>Coral bleaching in 2016, 2017 and 2020 has further damaged its health and affected its animal, bird and marine population, the International Union for Conservation of Nature said. Bleaching occurs when hotter water destroys the algae that the coral feeds on, causing it to turn white. The report also found that if Australia warmed up to 2°C, only 1 per cent of the reef is expected to survive.</description>

			<description>The United Nations estimates that animal agriculture accounts for more than 14% of global emissions. A seminal 2018 report, which this new analysis builds on, found that the world’s top 35 beef and dairy producers alone account for 15% of all those emissions. One of the gnarliest issues with animal agriculture is, of course, methane produced from cows. Methane is a short-term greenhouse gas &#45; it doesn’t stay in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide &#45; but it is substantially more potent and can cause more damage while it’s in there. Research published last year found that global annual methane emissions increased 9% from 2000 to 2017—the equivalent of doubling the total carbon dioxide emissions of Germany or France—largely as a result of agriculture.</description>

			<description>According to the Migration Data Portal, which provides comprehensive global migration statistics, &#34;in the first half of 2020 alone, disasters displaced 9.8 million people and remained the leading trigger of new internal displacements globally. Five countries accounted for nearly 75 per cent of the new internal displacements due to disasters in the first half of 2020 with India leading the pack, accounting for nearly three million people, followed by Bangladesh (2.5 million), Philippines (811,000), China (791,000) and Somalia (514,000).&#34; Delta regions that are home to 500 million people worldwide will contribute an inordinate share to such migration, since these areas are considered climate change hot spots, places where high levels of exposure to climate stressors coincide with high levels of vulnerability.</description>

			<description>The loss of productivity comes even as billions has been poured into improving agricultural production through the development of new seeds, sophisticated farm machinery and other technological advances. &#34;Even though globally agriculture is more productive, that greater productivity on average doesn’t translate into more climate resilience,&#34; said Ariel Ortiz&#45;Bobea, an author of the paper and associate professor at Cornell&#39;s Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management. The damages to productivity growth aren’t evenly spread across regions. Warmer areas &#45; especially those in the tropics &#45; are more detrimentally affected. Ortiz&#45;Bobea said that coincides with many countries where agriculture makes up a bigger share of the economy.</description>

			<description>BlackRock manages about $7 trillion in assets and, with one of Wall Street’s biggest voices sounding the alarm about the need to deal with the climate crisis, the news was viewed as a pivotal moment for the financial community. But for &#91;Tariq&#93; Fancy, who now runs the digital learning nonprofit Rumie in Toronto, Canada, BlackRock&#39;s move, and the ones it has inspired, contain a fundamental flaw: the climate crisis can never be solved by today&#39;s free markets. &#34;It’s not because they are evil, it’s because the system is built to extract profits,&#34; he said.</description>

			<description>The campaign is a citizens initiative for carbon pricing in the EU, born after the suggestion of 27 Nobel Prize winners to &#34;shift taxes from labour to CO2 emissions&#34;. The text asks for revenues to flow into the ecological transition, while taxes on workers are expected to lower.</description>

			<description>The survey further showed that while 95 per cent of respondents extoll the importance of global cooperation in overcoming common challenges, only one in four felt confident that the world would be able to address these issues. UNESCO said that &#34;taken together, the results suggest not a lack of appreciation of the importance of multilateralism but rather a crisis of faith in its effectiveness.&#34;</description>

			<description>When you set fire to trees, for instance, as part of slash-and-burn farming or ranching, you&#39;re not just getting rid of a carbon-sucking machine. You&#39;re releasing methane, which is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide and lingers in the atmosphere for a dozen years. You&#39;re changing the color of the earth’s surface from green to brown or black, which affects how the earth absorbs rather than reflects the sun&#39;s rays. And you&#39;re spraying black carbon into the atmosphere, which changes its reflectivity and traps more heat. All of these factors, the researchers found, work together in extremely complex and little-understood ways.</description>

			<description>&#34;The developed world has occupied almost 80% of the carbon space already, you have 800 million people who don't have access to electricity. You can't say that they have to go to net zero, they have the right to develop, they want to build skyscrapers and have a higher standard of living, you can't stop it,&#34; &#91;Raj Kumar Singh, India's minister for power&#92; told the meeting &#91;organised by the International Energy Agency&#92;.</description>

			<description>It&#39;s not just the size of the ships; the world&#39;s fleet has quadrupled in size since the 1980s. That&#39;s increased the strain on our oceans by exacerbating underwater noise levels, harming whales and dolphins. It has caused the rise of plastic waste dumping, oil discharge and the shuttle of invasive species around the globe, causing the extinction of native plants and marine animals.</description>

			<description>Inevitably, because the path to decarbonisation (and digitalisation) has already transcended the realm of run-of-the-mill economic competition to become embroiled in fraught geopolitics, attention has squarely turned onto the indispensable inputs that are required to produce them. Both the global decarbonisation of the economy and the fourth industrial revolution rely on rare earths and a growing number of other critical minerals (CRMs), such as lithium and cobalt, that are all highly geographically concentrated and vulnerable to disruption. Moreover, the amounts needed will skyrocket moving forward.</description>

			<description>The intensification of conditions due to climate change means more people are being driven from their homes and land by sea level rises, storms, cyclones, drought, erosion, landslides, flooding and salinisation of the land. It's estimated that by 2050, one in every seven people in Bangladesh will become a climate migrant.

			<description>The purpose of pledges to stabilise temperature rise at close to 1.5°C is to avoid the worst of these consequences. But despite the commitments made in the Paris agreement &#45; and, in the years since, various countries’ plans to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions to zero &#45; the world is still on track to exceed 2°C of warming. (Even if all countries meet their targets, climate scientists predict that temperatures will rise by 2.3°-2.4°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.) A seemingly small difference in degrees will have a big impact on how habitable the world remains.</description>

The full bloom, or Sakura in Japanese, historically occurs on 17 April &#45; but in more recent times, warmer and earlier springs have meant earlier blooms, according to climate change experts.</description>

			<description>The summit this year is seen as a last chance to keep to the goals of the Paris agreement and also to limit temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to stay below 1.5C within reach. It will be the UK&#39;s most important moment on the world stage for generations, he said, warning that the latest emission figures from the UN, which make clear the world is on course for a catastrophic 3C of warming, were being ignored by too many politicians. &#34;It is like these numbers are the embarrassing uncle we want to pretend does not exist &#45; so let’s talk about everything else, let’s talk about 2050, let’s talk about 2060 ... but we don’t have the luxury of time ... The pressure, the action has got to be now.&#34;</description>

			<description>Although gas helped decarbonise Britain&#39;s grid, it is a hindrance when it comes to heating and transport. That is because Britain has one of the world’s most robust and extensive infrastructures for moving gas around; 85% of its 29m homes are heated with gas boilers. In Germany 47% are. Decades of investment in the gas grid mean that Britain&#39;s electricity grid is not as robust as it needs to be in order to carry the extra power required to replace gas in the heating of Britain’s homes. If it is to charge all the cars and run all the heat pumps, the grid will need to be upgraded at a cost of tens of billions of pounds.</description>

			<description>So far, there is little evidence that political leaders are willing or able to meet their collective Paris targets. Even so, some veteran climate experts see hope in the strikes, marches and other protests that are taking place around the world. &#34;Civil disobedience erupts when injustice has been collectively determined to be unbearable,&#34; says Christiana Figueres, who helped to usher in the Paris agreement as head of the UN climate convention in 2015. &#34;And that is where we are today.&#34;</description>

			<description>Individual responsibility has become something of a flashpoint in the climate discourse. On the one hand, oil companies love to harp on about personal carbon footprints as a way of distracting from their much larger contributions to the climate crisis, both through the fossil fuel products they make and their longstanding, ongoing efforts to delay climate action and misinform the public. At the same time, prominent journalists and scientists have waved off individual climate actions as a distraction from the systemic changes that are needed to solve the crisis—changes like overhauling our electricity and transit systems through governmental investments in clean energy, better regulation, and carbon pricing. They&#39;re joined by a growing chorus of climate justice advocates who rightly point out that asking poor people to make difficult dietary shifts or give up the car they need to get to work is completely unfair.</description>

			<description>Recycling is not the solution. Only 9% of all plastic produced gets recycled—and even that low number is likely a gross overestimation. Plastic waste exported from the country where it was discarded counts as “recycled,” regardless of its actual fate. And virgin plastic is so cheap that there is no financial incentive for companies to use recycled plastic in their products. In short, plastic recycling is a myth—and always has been.</description>

			<description>There is a clear crossover between civil and nuclear industries in the US, the UK, China, Russia and France. This is made more obvious because of the few countries that have renounced nuclear weapons − for example only Germany, Italy and Spain have shown no interest in building any kind of nuclear station. This is simply because renewables are cheaper and produce low carbon power far more quickly.</description>

			<description>Mel Evans from Greenpeace said: “This is a colossal failure. The UK will make a fool of itself in the run-up to hosting the COP26 global climate talks if our energy minister signs off on new oil and gas licences that serve to rip up the Paris Agreement (the world deal to hold global temperature rise to 1.5C)."</description>

			<title>Big banks’ trillion-dollar finance for fossil fuels ‘shocking’, says report</title>

			<description>A commitment to be net zero by 2050 has been made by 17 of the 60 banks, but the report describes the pledges as “dangerously weak, half-baked, or vague”, arguing that action is needed today. Some banks have policies that block finance for coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, but almost two-thirds of funding is for oil and gas companies.</description>

			<description>The producers' slice of the pie comes in at $71 billion in 2018 and averaged $62 billion over the study period. Gasoline was the largest portion of that, averaging $25 billion, with coal and natural gas varying with the changing usage pattern. Here, the split was quite different, with gasoline and diesel coming in at under $50 billion, natural gas at about $20 billion, and coal at about $10 billion.</description>

			<title>Ending Fossil Fuel Subsidies the Wrong Way Could End Up Hurting the Poor</title>

			<source url="https://truthout.org/articles/elite-led-efforts-to-end-fossil-fuel-subsidies-have-a-hidden-neoliberal-agenda">Truthout</source>
			<description>If the dollar value of subsidies has indeed been inflated for political and ideological purposes, then the same can be said of the emissions reductions estimates that derive from them. The IMF maintains that, if users paid the “full price” for fossil-based energy, consumption would fall and a more efficient use of energy would eventually follow. But the relationship between prices, fossil fuel use, and emissions reductions is based on what economists call “elasticities.” Research has shown that the “price-demand ratio” can be quite pronounced when consumers have alternative energy options. But when alternatives don’t exist—which is often the case—increases in prices produce a “low to moderate” reduction in demand. According to the IMF, “Consistent, country-level models of how fossil fuel use responds to price reform are not yet available on a wide scale.” In other words, the IMF’s assertion that “getting energy prices right” will dramatically curtail energy use is politically convenient, but it is not always supported by the data.</description>

			<description>Instead of asking “What can I do to stop feeling so anxious?”, “What can I do to save the planet?” and “What hope is there?”, people with privilege can be asking “Who am I?” and “How am I connected to all of this?” The answers reveal that we are deeply interconnected with the well-being of others on this planet, and that there are traditions of environmental stewardship that can be guides for where we need to go from here.</description>

			<description>Bitcoin still commands strong support in libertarian circles, and that’s significant because right-wing ideologies are historically disdainful of government action to address climate change. David Golumbia’s "The Politics of Bitcoin" illuminates the deep connections between crypto-anarchist Bitcoin pioneers and the free-market fundamentalism that still pervades a substantial segment of the Bitcoin community.</description>

			<description>So how, with our limited human minds, do we attend enough to make real progress? How do we not flinch and look away? The truth of what is happening shakes the foundations of our sense of self. It asserts a distorting gravity, bending our priorities and warping our whole lives. The overt denialists are easy villains, the monsters who look like monsters. But the rest of us, much of the time, wear pretty green masks over our self-interest and denial, and then go about our days. Then each morning we wake to a new headline like: “The planet is dying faster than we thought.</description>

			<description>For tech companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Zoom, India under Modi has turned into a harsh moment of truth. In North America and Europe, these companies are going to great lengths to show that they can be trusted to regulate hate speech and harmful conspiracies on their platforms while protecting the freedom to speak, debate, and disagree that is integral to any healthy society. But in India, where helping governments hunt and imprison peaceful activists and amplify hate appears to be the price of access to a huge and growing market, “all of those arguments have gone out the window,” one activist told me. And for a simple reason: “They are profiting from this harm.”</description>

			<source url="https://newatlas.com/environment/fossilized-plants-greenland-ice-sheet">New Atlas</source>
			<description>Finding these frozen plants may sound like an intriguing curiosity, but the researchers say there’s a concerning implication to the discovery. It suggests that the Greenland Ice Sheet is more susceptible to climate change than anticipated – which is a problem, considering it contains enough ice that, if it were to completely melt, it would raise sea levels by 7.2 m (24 ft) alone. Worse still, a recent report found that the ice sheet has lost 3.8 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, and the rate is accelerating.</description>

			<title>The economics of covering California’s water system with solar panels</title>

			<description>There are a number of things, however, that make these calculations more complicated than the economic analysis would suggest. For example, the cabling over the canals could potentially complicate maintenance, even if said maintenance wouldn't have to happen as often. And the canals aren't always located near sites that would be easy to connect to California's power grid. Unlike a more compact site, wiring up a long, stretched-out row of panels could add considerably to the cost.</description>

			<description>Global Energy Monitor examined potential methane releases at 432 proposed new or expanded coal mines, and found that at the gassiest of them the leaks could account for half of their total greenhouse gas impact. If all were built, about 13.5 million tons of methane would be released annually, doing the damage of an equivalent of more than 1 billion tons of CO2.</description>

			<description>In an internal technical report in 1968, Shell [warned] that air pollution "may, in extreme situations, be deleterious to health" and [acknowledged] the oil industry “reluctantly” must accept that cars "are by far the greatest sources of air pollution". The report states that sulphur dioxide, given off by the burning of oil, can cause “difficulty in breathing” while nitrogen dioxide, also given off by vehicles and power plants, can cause lung damage and that “there will be a clamor to reduce [nitrogen dioxide] emissions, probably based on suspected long-term chronic effects”.</description>

			<description>This paper presents a review of psychology research that can help people begin to assess the different ways they can responsibly support each other to talk about their thoughts and feelings on their perceptions of societal disruption and collapse, at home and abroad, due to environmental and climate change. It includes a summary of a review of published studies in psychology on matters of anticipating difficult futures, including vulnerability, disruption, disaster, suffering and mortality. The claims by both specialists and non-specialists that collapse anticipation is necessarily harmful to mental health and social engagement is shown to be theoretically and empirically weak.</description>

			<description>Agriculture makes up about 10&#37; of emissions in the US, much of it from cows that belch, and to a lesser extent, fart out methane. This has led to some climate campaigners to urge people to eat less meat but the UC Davis researchers said that existing meat production could be made better for the climate by putting seaweed on the menu for cattle.</description>

			<description>A strange sort of faith lies at the core of mainstream climate advocacy—a largely unexamined belief that the very system that got us into this mess is the one that will get us out of it. For a community putatively committed to scientific empiricism, this is an extraordinary conviction. Despite reams of increasingly apocalyptic research, and despite 25 years of largely fruitless international climate negotiations, carbon emissions have continued to rise, and temperatures along with them. We are at nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius of warming already—more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit over preindustrial averages—and three-tenths of a degree away from blowing the Paris accord’s aspiration to limit warming to a still-calamitous 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists now expect us to hit that threshold in about 10 years, and large swaths of the Arctic have been in actual flames for two summers running, but most governments with the option to do so are still feeding the beast that got us here.</description>

			<description>Since we have already drawn down over 120 Gt of CO2 from this carbon budget, we have now less than 300 Gt left. Combining the proved fossil fuel reserves reported in British Petroleum’s Statistical Review of World Energy with CO2 emission factors from the IPCC yields 3,600 Gt of CO2 emissions. This means that we can only afford to burn one twelfth of the fossil fuels we have already found. And this does not account for any greenhouse gas emissions from the ongoing melting of permafrost. The Arctic region alone is estimated to have 1,500 Gt of carbon stored in its soils, some of which is already being converted to CO2 by microbes and released into the atmosphere.</description>

			<description>Ignoring the fact that every dollar spent subsidizing oil diverts money away from other societally valuable enterprises &#45; say public health, mass transit or feeding the hungry &#45; the dollars are still staggering. Internationally, depending on the price of oil, governments provide up to $1 trillion in subsidies, each year. Add costs related to climate change and other despoiling of the environment, plus war and negative health impacts, and, according to a 2015 study by the International Monetary Fund, the unpaid costs of fossil fuels clock in each year at around $5.3 trillion annually &#45; or a breathtaking $10 million a minute. Don’t hold us to it, but that’s more money even than Jeff Bezos makes.</description>

			<description>Photosynthesis is only 1&#37; efficient. Solar panels are 20&#37; efficient. Thus, a solar panel needs 1/20th the land as a biofuel to produce the same energy. On top of that, an electric car uses 1/4th the energy as an internal-combustion engine car to go the same distance. Thus, a battery-electric car running on solar energy uses 1/80th the land as an ethanol-fueled car.</description>

			<description>According to calculations conducted by the report’s 26 authors, bottom trawling is responsible for one gigaton of carbon emissions a year—a higher annual total than (pre-pandemic) aviation emissions. Not only does the practice contribute to climate change, it is extremely damaging to ocean biodiversity—the “equivalent of ploughing an old-growth forest into the ground, over and over and over again until there is nothing left” according to lead author Enric Sala, a marine biologist who is also National Geographic’s Explorer in Residence.</description>
